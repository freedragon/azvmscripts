This template allows deploying a linux VM using new or existing resources for the Virtual Network, Storage and Public IP Address.  It also injects the custom script into the VM, configures cron jobs which will run the scripts as per the configuration.

This Raadme file is still a work in progress (though deploy button should work)....
